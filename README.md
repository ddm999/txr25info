uh oh! another one!

to build site:
`./convert.py` converts data from FModel jsons to smaller friendlier "web" jsons
`./graph_pu.py` generates power unit graphs
`./build.py` actually builds the sites from the templates & friendly "web" jsons

i will probably restructure this at some point
so that it doesn't end up with loads of stuff in the base folder like gt7info did
